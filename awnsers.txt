ep1 

The murderer is Miss Scarlet,
miss scarlet is the string stored in the key murderer

ep2

will throw an error because murderer is declared as a const with a scope of the whole document and cannot be change by the function changeMurderer

ep3

will be both peacock and pr plum, first verdict is using the murderer within the declare murderer scope and the second verdict will use the murderer variable which has the scope of the whole page

Ep4

Although suspects will print out scarlet, plum and mustard the final log will print out suspect three being peacock because its never changed in the global scope

Ep5 

Verdict will print out revolver as when it is changed in the changeWeapon function it is done in a global scale not blocked within the function

Ep6 
In the plot twist murdered is declared globally meaning the verdict will equal mrs white 

Ep7
Verdict will result in miss scarlet being the murdered as its declared globally,
Got this wrong now assuming that it is changing the let murder from the plot twist which is only stored locally not global like the murder =  mr. green

Ep8
Change scenario will set dining room as the key value of room
Plot twist sets the murder to custard as room == dining room 
And then that sets the weapon to candle stick 
So outcome will be candle stick

Ep9
Murderer will be professor plum as the if statement has a let so it is only assigning that murderer localally
